# CSSClock
A small CSS clock controlled by a java script.
The time of the clock can be changed by using the "setTime" function on the html elments with the "clock" class.
The standard design to insert a clock is always:
\<div class="clock"\>
    \<div class="clockCenter"></div>
    \<div class="pointerLong longPointer"></div>
    \<div class="pointerLong shortPointer"></div>
\</div\>
